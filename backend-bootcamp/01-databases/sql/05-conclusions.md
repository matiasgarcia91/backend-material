# Conclusions

SQL is an amazingly powerful language that is used in all industries IT-related. It also takes some time to really be able to do anything you like in SQL, so practice if this is something that you want to achieve! Postgres has very good [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-select.html) although they can be a bit overwhelming. [DB-fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) can be a nice tool to just test some things, but with bigger datasets you want to run your own Postgres database.
